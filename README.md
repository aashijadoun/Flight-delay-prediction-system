Flight delays are a result of a broad range of circumstances that include weather, technical problems, congestion in air traffic, and crew availability.  These are responsible for both linear patterns and detailed non-linear tendencies in the data, therefore anticipating delay is not an easy process.  Conventional time series models like ARIMA or SARIMA are most effective in simulating linear components and seasonality like day-to-day or week-to-week variation.  However, such models fail in discovering anomalous, abrupt changes or understanding long-term dependencies.  Conversely, deep learning models, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, can comprehend non-linear patterns and observe long-term temporal dependencies.  However, LSTM models in isolation might not be able to model seasonality if they are not specially trained to identify such patterns.  Thus, our method is the merging of both SARIMA and LSTM models within a hybrid framework that aims to take the strengths of both worlds â€” SARIMA for capturing seasonal and linear patterns, and LSTM for capturing non-linear, complex patterns in the residual components of the time series.
